# Stats_Project
## Project Summary
In this project we explored the factors that contribute to Intimate Partner Violence statistics in the United States (state by state analysis) and in New York city (by Community Districts). Intimate Partner Violence accounts for 8 million lost work days each year, one in three female murder victims were killed by intimate partners. We asked ourselves several questions that can be answed by performing statistical analysis (hypothesis testing): 

- Is there a correlation between Age of Marriage and IPV?

- Are Foreign born women more likely to experience IPV? 

- Did the situation change between 2017 and 2018? 

- How do key community district indicators correlate with IPV? Do wealthier neighborhoods report fewer IPV incidents? 

- Do the boroughs differ in terms of different forms of DV?
